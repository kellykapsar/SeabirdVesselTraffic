# Seabird-Vessel Traffic Risk Analysis

## Overview

The **Seabird-Vessel Traffic** repository contains R scripts for evaluating the seasonal risk of interactions between seabirds and vessel traffic. This project aims to provide insights into potential conflicts between seabird populations and maritime activities, helping in the identification of high-risk areas and times. The scripts analyze data and generate visualizations to facilitate informed decision-making and conservation efforts.

## Introduction

Seabirds are crucial indicators of marine ecosystem health, and vessel traffic can pose a threat to their populations through disturbances and collisions. This repository contains R scripts that assess the risk of seabird-vessel interactions across different seasons. By analyzing vessel density, seabird distribution, and other relevant factors, these scripts offer valuable insights into potential conflict zones.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following software and packages installed:

- R (version x.x.x)
- RStudio (optional but recommended)
- Required R packages (list and version)

## Installation

Provide instructions on how to clone or download the repository. Additionally, if there are any specific installation steps, dependencies, or setup, mention them here.

## Usage

Explain how to run the scripts and what inputs they require. Include examples of command-line usage or RStudio execution. If there are any optional parameters or customizations, describe them here.

## Data

Describe the data sources used by the scripts. Include details about data format, structure, and any preprocessing steps required. If possible, provide links to example datasets or instructions on where to obtain them.

## Scripts

List and briefly explain the main scripts included in the repository. Provide a high-level overview of what each script does and how it contributes to the project's goals.

1. **data_preprocessing.R**: This script handles the preprocessing of raw vessel and seabird data. It combines, cleans, and organizes the datasets into a format suitable for analysis.

2. **vessel_density_analysis.R**: Analyzes vessel density patterns across different seasons using spatial analysis techniques. Generates density maps and statistics.

3. **seabird_distribution_analysis.R**: Examines the distribution of seabird populations during different times of the year. Produces visualizations illustrating their movement patterns.

4. **risk_evaluation.R**: Integrates vessel density and seabird distribution data to calculate and visualize the risk of interactions. Highlights areas of concern and suggests mitigation strategies.

## Results

Explain the types of results or visualizations that the scripts generate. Provide examples of output figures or tables. This section should give users an idea of what insights they can gain from running the scripts.

## Contributing

Explain how others can contribute to the repository. Include guidelines for submitting issues, feature requests, or pull requests. Make sure to specify any coding standards or testing procedures.

## License

Specify the license under which the repository and its contents are released. Provide a brief overview of what users can and cannot do with the code.
